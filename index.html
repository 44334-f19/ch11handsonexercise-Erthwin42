This includes uses for the advancement of public interest, such as education, especially when the amount of copied work is small and the original author/artist is given appropriate credit. Some uses may be considered approved by implication, such as public e-mail lists, or possibly forum posts, where forwarding and archiving is considered to be pre-approved unless the author expressly forbids it. <span class="emphasis">Usage that generates income or otherwise interferes with the original owner's income, is not considered fair use.</span> The overall design, links, original text, graphics, audio, and video, along with other unique and original elements, of a website are covered by copyright law. Internet users cannot transfer or copy from a site and post them without permission from the owner without breaking copyright law. <span class="emphasis">If you are unsure of whether something is Fair Use or not it is advised to request permission to use or not to use the work at all.</span></p>
